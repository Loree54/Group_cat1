<h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
<p>
The main goal of this project was to design and implement a user-friendly web application 
that can accurately convert numbers between different number systems 
(Binary, Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal). 
The project demonstrates both theoretical understanding and practical implementation 
of number system conversions.
</p>

<h2>🛠️ Tools & Technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Programming Language: <b>JavaScript (React)</b></li>
  <li>Hosting Platforms: <b>Netlify / Vercel</b></li>
  <li>Version Control: <b>Git & GitHub</b></li>
  <li>Development Environment: <b>Visual Studio Code & Termux (optional)</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>📂 Process Followed</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Held discussions and agreed on the project scope.</li>
  <li>Planned the user interface and application flow.</li>
  <li>Divided responsibilities fairly among group members.</li>
  <li>Implemented the conversion logic in <code>converter.js</code>.</li>
  <li>Built the user interface with <code>App.jsx</code>.</li>
  <li>Pushed the project to GitHub for collaboration.</li>
  <li>Deployed the project on Netlify for live access.</li>
</ol>

<h2>🤝 Collaboration</h2>
<p>
Every group member actively participated by contributing code, reviewing changes, 
testing, and suggesting improvements. GitHub was used as the main collaboration platform 
to ensure fair participation.
</p>

<h2>⚡ Challenges & Solutions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Challenge:</b> Handling fractional numbers correctly (e.g., 101.101 in binary).<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Improved the conversion logic to process fractional parts accurately.</li>
  <li><b>Challenge:</b> Deploying on Netlify with correct configurations.<br>
      <b>Solution:</b> Adjusted build and base directory settings to ensure smooth deployment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>✅ Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The project was successful in demonstrating both theoretical knowledge and technical skills. 
The group worked as a team to deliver a fully functional and well-documented system. 
This process also enhanced our understanding of collaborative software development, 
problem-solving, and real-world deployment.
